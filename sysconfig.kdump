## Path:        System/Kernel/Kdump
## Description: Crash Dump Configuration

## Type:	string
## Default:	"kdump"
## ServiceRestart:	kdump
#
# Kernel Version string for the -kdump kernel, such as 2.6.16-5-kdump
# If no version is specified, then the init script will try to find a
# kdump kernel with the same version number as the running kernel.
# The init script will use a kernel named:
# /boot/vmlinux-$KDUMP_KERNELVER
# Using "kdump" will default to the most recently installed kdump kernel.
#
KDUMP_KERNELVER=""

## Type:	string
## Default:	""
## ServiceRestart:	kdump
#
# The kdump commandline is the command line that needs to be passed off to
# the kdump kernel.  This will likely match the contents of the grub kernel
# line.  For example:
#   KDUMP_COMMANDLINE="ro root=LABEL=/"
# If a command line is not specified, the default will be taken from
# /proc/cmdline
#
KDUMP_COMMANDLINE=""

## Type:        string
## Default:     ""
## ServiceRestart:     kdump
#
# Set this variable if you only want to _append_ values to the default
# command line string. The string gets also appended if KDUMP_COMMANDLINE
# is set.
#
KDUMP_COMMANDLINE_APPEND=""

## Type:	string
## Default:	""
## ServiceRestart:	kdump
#
# Additional arguments passed to kexec.  For example, to generate
# ELF32 dump on x86-64 to allow i386 systems to read dump, set
# "--elf32-core-headers" here.
#
# Keep this empty in most cases.
#
KEXEC_OPTIONS=""

## Type:	list(1,2,3,5,s)
## Default:	1
## ServiceRestart:	kdump
#
# The run-level to boot the kdump kernel.  The default is "1".
# If you need networks in the kdump environment, set "3".
#
KDUMP_RUNLEVEL="1"

## Type:	yesno
## Default:	yes
#
# Immediately reboot after saving the core in the kdump kernel?
# This option is ignored when KDUMP_DUMPDEV is set to a non-empty
# value. Use "yes" or "no". Default is "yes".
#
KDUMP_IMMEDIATE_REBOOT="yes"

## Type:	string
## Default:	""
#
# A script or command executed to process and transfer the dump image.
# It can read the dump image either via /proc/vmcore or /dev/oldmem.
#
# Keeping this empty will use the default dumper, which copies the vmcore
# file to $KDUMP_SAVEDIR with some system checks.
#
KDUMP_TRANSFER=""

## Type:	string
## Default:	"file:///var/log/dump"
#
# Which directory should the dumps be saved in by the default dumper?
# This can be:
#
#   - a local file, for example "file:///var/log/dump" (or, deprecated,
#     just "/var/log/dump")
#   - a FTP server, for example "ftp://user:password@host/var/log/dump"
#   - a SSH server, for example "ssh://user@host/var/log/dump"
#     please create a user that needs no password or set up public key
#     authorization for the root user of the system -- or you have to enter
#     the password on the serial console as the VGA console may not work!
#   - a NFS share, for example "nfs://server:/export:/var/log/dump"
#   - a CIFS (SMB) share, for example
#     "cifs://user:password@host:/share/var/log/dump"
#
# For the exact URLs, see kdump-url_parser(8) manual page. Or use the
# YaST2 kdump module to configure this if you're unsure.
KDUMP_SAVEDIR="file:///var/log/dump"

## Type:	integer
## Default:	5
#
# Specifies how many old dumps are kept.  If the number of dump files
# exceeds this number, older dumps are removed.
#
# You can prevent the automatic removal by setting zero to this.
# Set KDUMP_KEEP_OLD_DUMPS to "-2" is you want to delete all old
# dumps before saving the new dump.
#
# The default value is 5.
#
KDUMP_KEEP_OLD_DUMPS=5

## Type:	integer
## Default:	64
#
# Specifies the minimal free disk space (in MB unit) on the dump
# partition.  If the free disk space is less than the sum of this
# value and memory size, the default dumper won't save vmcore file
# in order to keep the system sane.
#
# Setting zero forces to dump without check.
# The default value is 64MB.
#
KDUMP_FREE_DISK_SIZE=64

## Type:        string
## Default:     ""
#
#
# Specifies the dump device that is used for saving the dump with the kdump
# kernel. The dump device normally is a disk partition. You don't need to
# specify a dump device here. Then the dump is written to KDUMP_SAVEDIR when
# booting from the kdump kernel.
#
# If KDUMP_DUMPDEV points to a device file, the dump is written to that device
# when running the kdump kernel. The advantage over writing the dump to
# disk immediately is that you don't have to mount the root file system (which
# may be corrupted!) just to write the dump. So if the root file system is
# corrupted, you have the chance to fix the file system manually and reboot the
# system without loosing the dump information. On the first normal boot which
# is able to successfully mount the root file system, the dump is saved to
# KDUMP_SAVEDIR as usual.
#
# Important: The KDUMP_DUMPDEV is overwritten by kdump, so don't use it for
# saving any data. Also don't use the currently used swap partition.
#
KDUMP_DUMPDEV=""

## Type:        integer
## Default:     3
#
# Determines if kdump uses verbose output. This value is a bitmask:
#
# 1: kdump command line is written to system log when executing
#    /etc/init.d/kdump
# 2: progress is written to stdout while dumping
# 4: kdump command line is written so standard output when executing
#    /etc/init.d/kdump
# 8: Debugging for kdump transfer script
KDUMP_VERBOSE=3

## Type:        integer
## Default:     0
#
# Determines the dump level. If KDUMP_DUMPLEVEL != 0, then makedumpfile
# is used to strip pages that may not be necessary for analysing. 0 means
# no stripping, and 31 is the maximum dump level, i.e. 0 produces the
# largest dump files and 31 the smallest.
#
# The following table from makedumpfile(8) shows what each dump level
# means:
#                 dump | zero | cache|cache  | user | free
#                level | page | page |private| data | page
#               -------+------+------+-------+------+------

KDUMP_DUMPLEVEL=0

## Type:        string
## Default:     "ELF"
#
# This variable specifies the dump format.
#
# "ELF" has the advantage that it's a standard format and GDB can be used to
# analyse the dumps. The disadvantage is that the dump files are larger.
#
# "compressed" is the kdump compressed format (see makedumpfile(8)) that
# produces small dumps. However, only "crash" can analyse the dumps and
# you need makedumpfile to have installed (but you need it anyway if you
# set KDUMP_DUMPLEVEL != 0 before).
