    and contain too huge test data.
  * Honor TMPDIR and set that to disk space instead of the ramdisk when saving
    the dump in the initrd.

0.6.7
-----

-----
  * Fix wrong path when modifying the /etc/sysconfig/kdump file when creating
    the kdump initrd.

    used.
  * Assume a default terminal size of 80x25 (for printing the horizontal line)
  * Check the exit status of kdumptool

    and KDUMP_NOTIFICATION_TO are empty.
